# image classification on covid 19 dataset

Image Classification Project
This project is an implementation of image classification using different classification models, including traditional machine learning and deep learning.
Models
The following models were built:
•	Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
•	Fully Connected Neural Network (FNN)
Dataset

It contains around 137 cleaned images of COVID-19 and 317 in total containing Viral Pneumonia and Normal Chest X-Rays structured into the test and train directories.

Results
The result demonstrates how efficient Neural Networks are at image classifications.
